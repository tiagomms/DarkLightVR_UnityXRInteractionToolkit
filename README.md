## A VR experience for the HTC Vive

### Description
A High Immersion VR experience about forgiving oneself and starting a path of consciousness, healing and inner peace.
The users will go through stages - from baby to hopefully a glimpse of inner peace.
You may find the scope of the project in more detail in the word document in the repo: *Capstone Pre-Production Scoping Document*

### Project Duration
It took me 3 months to complete - 1 month and a half to learn 3D modelling, making the character and scenes, the rest for VR Development.  
(This project, like the rest of the Udacity's VR Nanodegree course was made after working hours)
